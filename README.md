# Rocket

Programming of hardware inside an L1 rocket. Utilizing an Arduino, RF Transmitter, BMP, and GPS to gather barometric and location data.

in process: 
code to use BMP180 sensor with Arduino and an HC12 RF to collect barometric data while Rocket in flight

in near future:
code for BN-880 GPS to send final coordinates of Rocket after landing


180BMPsketchA:  

  code to connect bmp180 to arduino, and output data to command line, testing passed

180BMPsketchB: 

  input bmp180 data into hc12, (reciever)
